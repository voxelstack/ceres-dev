A `$boundary` tries to render all of its children but if an error happens it will render a fallback instead. Boundaries keep errors contained and prevent them from breaking the entire app.

{% highlight typescript %}
$fragment(
    $element("span", {}, "Still working... Still working... Mmm..."),
    $boundary(
        $element("span", {}, "Oh noes, something went wrong >.<"),

        $element("span", { use: {
            explode: () => { throw new Error("kaboom!"); }
        }}),
        $element("span", {}, "This wasn't my fault ;-;")
    )
)
.mount(document.body);
{% endhighlight %}

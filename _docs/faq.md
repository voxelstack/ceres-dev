## How is the performance?
I can't imagine it's good, but that's (mostly) for a known reason. See the [TODOs]({% link _docs/todo.md %}).

## Why are the docs not responsive?
The styles are placeholders so I don't have to look at a black and white page while writing them.

## Why are some of the types broken on the playground?
That's actually not the playground's fault, the editor has the correct type definitions. I have some things to fix on the API.

## Why is &lt;thing&gt; not &lt;ideal thing&gt;?
I'm doing this during my free time and there are things in life I value more than writing code (shocker, I know). Please be kind.

In case you're curious if I don't know what I'm doing or just haven't had the time to do it properly yet, [send me an email](mailto:voxelstack@gmail.com) and I'll be happy to chat about it.
